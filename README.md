# Boris Bikes

This was the first week's project of makers academy. It was the first time I'd pair programmed and used github with command line.
The actual challenge was to build a very simple model with a few basic classes to model getting and retreiving bikes from stands.
## usage

- Download this repo 
- Open a REPl terminal
- require all .rb files from lib
- create all the classes
- use these methods to interact with the bike rack
  - release_bike
  - dock(bike)
  - report_broken
  - pickup_bikes
